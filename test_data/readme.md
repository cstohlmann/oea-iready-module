# Test data

This module includes artifically generated data which matches the format of the four [i-Ready Diagnostic and Personalized Instruction Assessment Reports](https://www.curriculumassociates.com/programs/i-ready-assessment) for both ELA and Math subjects, resulting in a total of eight tables.
- <strong>Comprehensive Student Lesson Activity with Standards Report</strong> provides incremental assessment data on student learning per lesson completed. i-Ready summarizes this data by:
    - the lesson subject area (ELA or Math), 
    - the lesson domain (e.g. phonics, algebra), 
    - additional lesson details (e.g. lesson grade-level), 
    - whether a student passed or failed a particular lesson, 
    - some forms of SIS data (school the student attends, student name, etc.), and
    - lesson correlations with an education system's state standards.
- <strong>Personalized Instruction by Lesson Report</strong> provides the results surrounding student personalized instruction assessments. This table essentially serves as an overview of the <em>Comprehensive Student Lesson Activity with Standards</em> tables, without the matching of state standards.
- <strong>Diagnostic and Instruction YTD Window</strong> provides a year-long snapshot of assessment data on student learning diagnostics. These assessments can be used to identify students who may be at risk for reading/math difficulties. The assessment data also provides test results in specific areas of student-learning domains within ELA and Math. 
- <strong>Diagnostic Results Report</strong> provides the implications and iReady analyses of student diagnostic assessments. These include metrics used for gauging the successes/struggles of student learning (e.g. [Annual Stretch Growth Measure](https://www.curriculumassociates.com/access-and-equity/providing-a-path-to-proficiency-for-every-student)). The assessment data also provides test results in specific areas of student-learning domains within ELA and Math.

1) Rows in the table marked with "xxxxx" for their section indicate a separate section of the table where column sections are grouped together.
2) Anything in the above table marked with (x) indicates that the "x" is either replaced with "Most Recent", "1", "2", "3", "4", or "5". 
    - There is a section columns corresponding to each diagnostic assessment indicator.
2) Anything in the above table marked with (\_) indicates that the "\_" is either replaced with "Lexile" or "Quantile" depending on the ELA or Math table, respectively.
3) Anything in the above table marked with <strong>(Subject Domain)</strong> indicates that the entire parenthesis is to be replaced with one of the two sets of domains (the ELA table corresponds with the first set, and the Math table corresponds with the second set):
    - Phonological Awareness, Phonics, High-Frequency Words, Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension: Literature, and Reading Comprehension: Informational Text.
    - Number and Operations, Algebra and Algebraic Thinking, Measurement and Data, and Geometry.
4) With the last "Instruction:" section of columns (outlined above) both tables include an "Overall" section, which precedes the breakdown of subject domains.
